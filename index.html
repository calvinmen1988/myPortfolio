				<p>
					Calvin served on the same team as fellow Production Coordinators. During our time together, his expertise in the realm of
					QA oversight and testing protocol was obvious. He developed and implemented new reporting systems for both our external
					and internal testing groups, keeping both our development and publishing production teams well informed throughout the
					QA cycle. He significantly grew and improved the efficiency of processes within our team; partner that with his extensive
					knowledge of QA best practices and demonstrated leadership and you have an easy choice for a department Project Manager.
					I have no doubt he'll continue to build on quality standards wherever he goes in his career.
