	<header> <h1>Bio</h1> </header> 
	
	<p> My passion for technology has translated into more than eight years of experience in the realm of quality assurance (QA). Throughout my 8 years of QA experience, I have had the opportunity to hone both my QA testing skills and leadership skills. At Activision I had the opportunity to work on several high priority projects, such as Spider-Man 3 and several editions of Guitar Hero. As a Floor Lead at Activision, I gained efficient communication skills which emphasized documentation. After all, in the realm of QA testing, documentation allows all stakeholders to understand quality. </p>
 
	<p> In the last six years I've successfully progressed through various roles at Nexon. Within the last year alone, I moved from QA Tester to Production Coordinator to QA Project Manager. As a leader I strive to not only have my team work effectively, but to also exceed the standards of quality. Essentially I strive to find flaws and correct them before your customer does. At Nexon, I am recognized as one of the top contributors for quality products. </p>
 
	<p> In QA, I believe there is no such thing as a trickiest bug; there is only tricky methodology that will discover issues within a project. QA will always test against design of products/projects that is agreed upon by all stakeholders. The environment at your company seems both refreshing and inviting. Understanding and delivering quality products appears to be your top priority, which aligns perfectly with my professional standards and experience. Your tight-knit organization leads me to believe that you are willing to provide a great user experience; this makes all the difference, as I personally disengage from broken products. </p>
